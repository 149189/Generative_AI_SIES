Front-End Technology Roadmap for Full-Stack Web Development:

1.Basic Languages:

    HTML: Defines website content structure.
    CSS: Styles and layouts for websites.
    SQL: Language for database management.

2.Front-End Frameworks:
Bootstrap: Open-source toolkit for responsive projects.
AngularJS: Structural framework for dynamic web apps.
ReactJS: Library for building user interfaces in single-page applications.
VueJS: Compact and high-performance JavaScript framework.

3.JavaScript:

Just-in-time compiled language for dynamic website features.
Widely used in both front-end and back-end development.

4.TypeScript:
Developed by Microsoft for type checking in large applications.
Used in conjunction with JavaScript.

5.Back-End Technology Roadmap:
Express.js: Web application framework for Node.js.
NodeJS: Cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.
Django: High-level Python web framework with a clean design.
Ruby on Rails: Server-side web application framework based on Ruby.

6.Database Systems:
Relational (MySQL, SQLite, Postgres): Structured data storage.
NoSQL (MongoDB, Cassandra, Apache storm, Sphinx): Non-relational databases.
NewSQL (VoltDB, MemSQL): Relational databases using memory.

7.Additional Skills:
Git: Distributed version control system for tracking code changes.
Machine Learning: Incorporation of ML into web development.
SSH: Secure shell protocol for secure network service operation.
HTTP/HTTPS: Protocols defining web message transmission.
Linux Command-Line Basics: Understanding Linux for efficient backend organization.
Data Structures and Algorithms: Fundamental concepts for efficient problem-solving.
.Net and ASP.Net Framework: Building web and server-based applications.
Character Encoding: Essential for developing global applications.
